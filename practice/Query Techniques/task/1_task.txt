Task: Employee Hierarchy
You’re working with a company’s database that stores an employee hierarchy.
The employees table contains the following data:

employee_id	employee_name	manager_id
1	Alice	NULL
2	Bob	    1
3	Carol	1
4	Dave	2
5	Eve	    2
6	Frank	3

Requirements
Write a recursive query to retrieve all employees starting from a specific manager (e.g., Alice).
Include each employee’s employee_id, employee_name, their direct manager_id, and the level in the hierarchy (where Alice is level 1, her direct reports are level 2, and so on).
Order the results by level and then by employee_id.


Hints
The NULL in the manager_id column indicates the employee at the top of the hierarchy.
Use a CTE (Common Table Expression) for recursion.
Use an additional column in your CTE to track the hierarchy level.

Expected Result
If you start from Alice, the query should return something like this:

employee_id	employee_name	manager_id	level
1	Alice	NULL	1
2	Bob	    1	2
3	Carol	1	2
4	Dave	2	3
5	Eve	    2	3
6	Frank	3	3


Challenge
After completing the task, modify your query to calculate the total number of employees
under each manager recursively.
